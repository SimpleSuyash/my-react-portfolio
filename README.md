##  Description

The project is a personal portfolio webpage built using React. It showcases the my bio, recent works, and contact information. The portfolio provides a single-page experience for visitors to learn more about me and tmy skills. It includes sections for projects, skills, and a contact form for potential collaborations or inquiries.

By building this project, I gained experience in React development, including creating components, managing state, and handling user interactions. I also learnt how to structure a single-page application and incorporate different sections and features. Additionally, I have learnt about styling and layout using CSS or a CSS framework.

Overall, building this project provided me with practical experience in React development and web design, as well as an opportunity to showcase my skills and projects to potential clients or employers.
